# hello-world
This repository is to practice GitHub Flow. It's my first time using GitHub, I was told this was an excellent tool to keep my projects for the version control it provides. There's also a thriving community here that I wish to connect to as a CS major in college now! I can't wait to get started!
I'm Paarth! I am a CS and Stats major at Ohio State University and relatively new to the coding community online. I had an epiphany that I probably should start using GitHub by now.
I am following the tutorials to learn how GitHub works using GitHub Docs.
